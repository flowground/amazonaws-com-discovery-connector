    "description": "AWS Application Discovery Service AWS Application Discovery Service helps you\nplan application migration projects by automatically identifying servers,\nvirtual machines (VMs), software, and software dependencies running in your\non-premises data centers. Application Discovery Service also collects\napplication performance data, which can help you assess the outcome of your\nmigration. The data collected by Application Discovery Service is securely\nretained in an AWS-hosted and managed database in the cloud. You can export the\ndata as a CSV or XML file into your preferred visualization tool or\ncloud-migration solution to plan your migration. For more information, see AWS\nApplication Discovery Service FAQ\n[http://aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/faqs/].\n\nApplication Discovery Service offers two modes of operation:\n\n *   Agentless discovery mode is recommended for environments that use VMware\n   vCenter Server. This mode doesn't require you to install an agent on each\n   host. Agentless discovery gathers server information regardless of the\n   operating systems, which minimizes the time required for initial on-premises\n   infrastructure assessment. Agentless discovery doesn't collect information\n   about software and software dependencies. It also doesn't work in non-VMware\n   environments. \n   \n   \n *   Agent-based discovery mode collects a richer set of data than agentless\n   discovery by using the AWS Application Discovery Agent, which you install on\n   one or more hosts in your data center. The agent captures infrastructure and\n   application information, including an inventory of installed software\n   applications, system and process performance, resource utilization, and\n   network dependencies between workloads. The information collected by agents\n   is secured at rest and in transit to the Application Discovery Service\n   database in the cloud. \n   \n   \n\nWe recommend that you use agent-based discovery for non-VMware environments and\nto collect information about software and software dependencies. You can also\nrun agent-based and agentless discovery simultaneously. Use agentless discovery\nto quickly complete the initial infrastructure assessment and then install\nagents on select hosts.\n\nApplication Discovery Service integrates with application discovery solutions\nfrom AWS Partner Network (APN) partners. Third-party application discovery tools\ncan query Application Discovery Service and write to the Application Discovery\nService database using a public API. You can then import the data into either a\nvisualization tool or cloud-migration solution.\n\nApplication Discovery Service doesn't gather sensitive information. All data is\nhandled according to the AWS Privacy Policy [http://aws.amazon.com/privacy/].\nYou can operate Application Discovery Service offline to inspect collected data\nbefore it is shared with the service.\n\nThis API reference provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of\nthe actions and data types for Application Discovery Service. The topic for each\naction shows the API request parameters and the response. Alternatively, you can\nuse one of the AWS SDKs to access an API that is tailored to the programming\nlanguage or platform that you're using. For more information, see AWS SDKs\n[http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs].\n\nThis guide is intended for use with the AWS Application Discovery Service User\nGuide [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/latest/userguide/].",
